### About me

Hi there! I’m Rofikul Masud. My journey with computers started with curiosity and code, leading me to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Novosibirsk National Research State University. I am now preparing to begin my Master’s, keeping the dream of a PhD in Machine Learning firmly in sight.

Outside academia, I move between the worlds of history and arts. Classical music, both Western and South Asian, literature, philosophy, and documentaries shape how I see the world. Museums, theatres, and engaging debates remind me that understanding people is as important as understanding data.

I also enjoy writing, sharing reflections on history, art, and personal experiences through blogs and short stories. Language fascinates me as much as logic. I speak English and Russian fluently and I am currently learning German, enjoying the challenge of uncovering its subtle complexities.

Wish to talk, write me anytime!

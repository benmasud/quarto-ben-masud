Hi there! I’m Rofikul Masud, but you can call me Rafik, a recent Computer Science graduate from **Novosibirsk National Research State University (NSU)**. I’m on the cusp of beginning my **Master’s**, with the horizon of a **PhD in Machine Learning** always glimmering in the distance, because let’s face it, why solve one problem when you can spend a lifetime solving infinitely many?

My Bachelor’s thesis (NSU, 2025), whimsically titled *“Using Machine Learning Methods to Model and Interpret Problems in Determining the Parameters of the Medium Near the Well Using Signals from a High-Frequency Induction Logging While Drilling Device”*, allowed me to explore the subtle poetry hidden in data. From signals deep underground to patterns in code, I realized that machine learning is not just about algorithms; it is about listening, interpreting, and predicting the whispers of the world around us.

Beyond the confines of academia, I oscillate between the worlds of technology and the arts. Classical music, both Western and South Asian, literature, philosophy, and the occasional documentary are my companions. Museums, theatres, and open debates feed my curiosity and remind me that understanding the human condition is as important as understanding data.

I am also an avid writer, exploring thoughts on history, art, and personal experience through blogs and short stories. Language fascinates me as much as logic does. I speak English and Russian fluently, am a native Bengali speaker, and am currently grappling with the subtle intricacies of German.

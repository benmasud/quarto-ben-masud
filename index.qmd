Hi there! I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from **Novosibirsk National Research State University (NSU)** — right in the heart of the Russian academic hub in Western Siberia. I’m about to begin my **Master’s degree**, with plans to pursue a **PhD in Machine Learning fields**.

My Bachelor’s dissertation (NSU, 2025), titled *“Using Machine Learning Methods to Model and Interpret Problems in Determining the Parameters of the Medium Near the Well Using Signals from a High-Frequency Induction Logging While Drilling Device”*, explored the intersection of **data science** and **applied geophysics** — sparking my ongoing fascination with **machine learning research**.

Outside academics, I’m both a **tech enthusiast** and a **lover of the arts**. I enjoy classical music (Western and South Asian), reading (literature, history, and philosophy), and watching films and documentaries. I also love visiting theatres and museums, and engaging in open discussions and debates — something I developed a passion for during my school debating days.

I also enjoy **writing** — sharing thoughts on art, history, and personal experiences through blogs and short stories. Recently, I’ve been diving into **language learning**: I speak English and Russian fluently, and I’m currently learning German — not easy, but definitely rewarding!

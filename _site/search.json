    "text": "Rofikul Masud\n LinkedIn\n GitHub\n ORCID\n\n\n\nHi there! I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Novosibirsk National Research State University (NSU) — right in the heart of the Russian academic hub in Western Siberia. I’m about to begin my Master’s degree, with plans to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning fields.\nMy Bachelor’s dissertation (NSU, 2025), titled “Using Machine Learning Methods to Model and Interpret Problems in Determining the Parameters of the Medium Near the Well Using Signals from a High-Frequency Induction Logging While Drilling Device”, explored the intersection of data science and applied geophysics — sparking my ongoing fascination with machine learning research.\nOutside academics, I’m both a tech enthusiast and a lover of the arts. I enjoy classical music (Western and South Asian), reading (literature, history, and philosophy), and watching films and documentaries. I also love visiting theatres and museums, and engaging in open discussions and debates — something I developed a passion for during my school debating days.\nI also enjoy writing — sharing thoughts on art, history, and personal experiences through blogs and short stories. Recently, I’ve been diving into language learning: I speak English and Russian fluently, and I’m currently learning German — not easy, but definitely rewarding!"
